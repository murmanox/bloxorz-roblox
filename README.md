# bloxorz-roblox
remake of bloxorz in roblox using roblox-ts, roact and rodux.

Unfortunately this project has been inactive since I started working as a programmer. At some point during this time, the game has stopped working. It's probably an issue with the version of Roblox-TS I'm currently using, but I don't really want to look into it right now.

Luckily I occasionally take videos of my projects so I can look back at the progress I've made. Unluckily a lot of features and changes aren't visible in these recordings.

Here are some recordings of old and unpolished features:
